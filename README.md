## 🧐 The Problem
In Nigeria, legal intimidation is a tool used to silence the vulnerable.
- **Police Reports & Quit Notices** are written in complex jargon to confuse citizens.
- **Lawyers are expensive**, making justice inaccessible for the average person.
- **Fear triggers compliance**, causing people to sign away their rights without understanding them.

## 💡 The Solution
**CivicLens AI** is a digital legal companion that turns your phone into a defense attorney.
1.  **Scan:** Upload a photo of any legal document (police invite, court summons, landlord notice).
2.  **Analyze:** The AI extracts the text (OCR) and breaks it down into simple English and **Pidgin**.
3.  **Defend:** It identifies "Red Flags" (illegal threats) and quotes relevant **Nigerian Constitutional sections** to protect you.
4.  **Act:** It auto-generates a formal **legal reply letter** ready to print and sign.
